## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for Phillips Academy's Exhibition of Learning website.

In every computer science course at Phillips Academy, each student is tasked with creating an Exhibition of Learning video that showcases the skills they've practiced and the work they've accomplished during the course.

This website is responsible for hosting these videos. Administrators can manage video uploads, tags, and accounts through an admin dashboard. Visitors can search for videos by student, course number, year, trimester, and CS skill focus. The website also includes contributor biographies and an overview of the computer science skills covered in the curriculum.

## For administrators

Computer science faculty at Phillips Academy will receive administrator login information for the website. Please reach out to a current administrator if you need access!

Admins can upload videos by filling out a [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aa_OA5dHOu7ps5N8lpN580LpyOZo2NbgJCFGNTN51bY/copy) and sharing a public link with others. For more information on the upload process, please see the [upload instructions](README/eol_uploading_instructions.md).

Admins can create, edit, and delete individual videos and tags. Tags are pieces of metadata, such as course titles and years, associated with videos. Admins can also create, edit, and delete other admin accounts. **Use with caution!**

## For developers

The Exhibition of Learning website is currently hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Please see the [Heroku setup document](README/heroku_setup.md) for information on how to set up the website.
